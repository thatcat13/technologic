###  Questions to Consider:

* What do I want to prioritize to prep for the coming weeks, as well as after Epicodus?

I want to work through Javascript-based problems to improve my understanding of the language and to prepare for technical interviews. As of now my confidence is lower than I'd like in my problem-solving skills. Areas I can greatly improve in are solving JS problems that includes using technical language to describe the process. Fundamental understanding of Javascript is key to my future in coding since it's a powerful and ubiquitous tool in development.

My next priority would be to strengthen my design skills.  There are a few Epicodus-based projects I've created that I feel good about but I want to work toward making sites that are stunning to look at. I tend to like clean, simple formats. This is where my focus would start, utilizing Bootstrap, exploring Materialize, getting more comfortable with Flexbox and CSS Grid.  That said, I'd also want to improve my non-framework design skills since Flexbox/Grid support is still far from universal.
